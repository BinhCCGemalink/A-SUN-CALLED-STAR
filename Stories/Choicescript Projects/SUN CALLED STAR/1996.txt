[b]BUREAU OF INTERNAL AFFAIR SUSPICIONS REGARDING A.O#1996[/b]

1. January 11, 2023, Debriefing. Tape 1#E. Counter #423-438.

<even if it decided to play along with you, there are rules that even it would not care to break>

The scene open with a trashed police station in the outskirt of Da Nang. French architecture, old colonial building, restructured for local law enforcement.
*line_break
<attached with it are the floor plan>
*line_break
<crumpy, faded pictures of its old inhabitant, the shell damage from the hundred days bombing run… and its revival>

INAPPROPRIATELY HOMELY THOUGHTS: there was nothing of their home left. And this foundation is strong. And so they left, one ruined culture for another.

[b]CONTROL[/b]: [THEY FEAR THE RAIN]

*fake_choice
	#What else could anyone do? They killed those who could build it back.
	#Should have tried, at least. Reclaim those days, instead of... this.
	#Won the war, but... well. Is this winning?
		
<but it is a beautiful building though, isn't it?>

Beyond the threshold of the door and the sunny, bright day out they stood. Cladded in black kevlar and expensive equipment, chainmail sticking out from under the bullet-proof gas mask, gun in hand and consecrated steel in another holster the breached the silent sanctity of the empty police station.

CONTROL: Agent [CLEARANCE MISSING] and Agent [CLEARANCE MISSING]

<your hand felt cold touching the picture. you recognize one of them>

*fake_choice
	#[FAST FORWARD]
		The leading agent silently signed his hands in short communion, before moving forward. British armed force field signal, with few unorthodox hand signs. The other one merely nodded.
		
		[b]OUR REGRET:[/b] something flashed through my mind, beyond my notice. A memory so fast that it almost blended into reality of the situation at hand: sweaty palm, blood rush like drum over my ears and an unbearable weight on the sole of my right feet. Just a day after new year. Manhatthan down town was terrible for an alcoholic, as expected. And then… he always said, time is a flat circle.
		
		Slow step as they hug the wall, one watch the ceiling, the other the doors in the hallway behind the receptionist desk. Noon light flood through the windows. They are alone.
		
		[b]OUR REGRET[/b]: everything is so still, beside the waving shade of the tree outside. Someday, I could have retired here, perhaps with someone special, perhaps all of them. Its a beautiful country.
		
		<you disagreed>
		*fake_choice
			#No one ever retire from this line of work.
				<something to a way of life, or clinging regrets, or unsolved obsession, or just aimless, machine-like purpose of someone who had known nothing else>
				*line_break
				<there have been wonder, there have been strangeness, and there have been horror>
				*line_break
				<horror of the people in between all of that>  
			#It has never been beautiful at all.
				<all you could ever remembered are the cramp schools>
				*line_break
				<the endless heat>
				*line_break
				<a drought of rain>
				*line_break
				<then flood>
				*line_break
				<then storm>
				*line_break
				<and the infinity of roadkills in between them, looking from the side walk, feet sore, smelling black tar and roasted pork in the fume of the street…>
				*line_break
				<such… would get boring very quickly, the triviality of a domestic life here, by means or by meaning… it just another sort of bleakness>
			#Why not now? Why not?
				<then you would have died, and…>
				*line_break
				<but then, this wasn't about you>
				*line_break
				<its like an addiction, the researches into these being, there is no way someone like that would ever…>
		
		They take a moment before the threshold of the receptionist room and the deep hall way to the jail cells and the interrogation room. 		Red light blinking in the reflection of their gas mask as they looked at each other.
		
		[b]SCANNER LOG[/b]: compass direction nominal. Geiger counter steady, rising. Light reflection, refraction minimal. Spatial anomaly… 0.1 centimeter.
		
		Sound of plastic and metal. A fresh batch of electric-charged propellant, silver-tip specialty load in exchanged for the common anti-personnel buckshot. The vrrr vrrr sounds of real-space scanner soon become the only sound left in the room after the leading agent has finished his preparation and lead the way while the rear agent busy with the expensive equipment.
		
		<there is a note bellow "mission requisition list: American Observer Response Force, Operation Blue Sky, 2002 Counter-Offensive, Đông Hội war">
		*page_break
			#Old gear.
				<probably whatever they could scrape up, on short notice>
				
				THE VETERAN, ONE OF MANY: they are not obsolete, that is what mattered.
			#Heavy duty for a response to an anonymous target.
				<scouting trip want to be light, the unknown could be just another omniscient observer… or an ignorant one>
				
				THE VETERAN, ONE OF MANY: 
		
		[b]RECORD LOG[/b]: [fabrics scratches] [muffled breaths]
		
		<they look ridiculous, walking around like that in an empty room, uncanny even, to be so afraid of nothing at all>
		
		THE VETERAN, ONE OF MANY: no matter how much you train it, being human, there is just a degree of ridiculousness inherent in being stuffed full in guns and ammo and armor plates and all manner of heavy equipment that you bound to look like two clown trying to tip toe on a skating ring. But my mind do not think about how I will watch this back at home through a bottle of beer, having a good laugh. My mind is racing at the thought of our death approaching beyond this, in the hall, above the ceiling, behind that ugly fucking plastic chair they have in the corner.
		
		<his finger hurts from gripping the trigger guard>
		*line_break
		<you knew this>
		
		THE VETERAN, ONE OF MANY: because you would have done the same.
		
		They disappear beyond the threshold of the door.
		
		<the scene sped up still, until it all was a blur in your mind, spinning endlessly until red is the only color left between the statics>
		
		*fake_choice
			#"Our" regret?
				<yours, not mine. not yet>

				[b]OUR REGRET:[/b] …even if our eyes met, for a moment, on the way to my morning commute, where I found them linger more than I have intended… it will just be another thing that I forgot that day, like the shoddy lunch I have later, too late, in the afternoon and where my research note is on the table and if our milk has gone sour…
				
				<something about that frankness send an inexplicable feeling into your chest>
				
				[b]OUR REGRET[/b]: let it go…
			#Pull up the file on the Veteran.
				[b]CONTROL:[/b] [CLEARANCE MISSING]
				

		One last look at the rear before moving in. Leading agent with rifle, rear agent with a pistol and a resting arm. They disappear behind the hallway. The clip gone silent as the tape on this camera run out of memory, fast forwarding in a blur. Endlessly.
		
		A HUNCH: no silence. Loud. Too loud. A shadow in the flood. A face between the statics.
		
		<you cannot stop the tape from playing forward, as if it is compelled by a force unseen to avoid that shadow in between the frames>

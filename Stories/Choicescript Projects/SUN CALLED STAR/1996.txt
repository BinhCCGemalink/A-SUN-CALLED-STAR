<even if it decided to play along with you, there are rules that even it would not care to break>

The scene open with a trashed police station in the outskirt of Da Nang. French architecture, old colonial building, restructured for local law enforcement.
*line_break
<attached with it are the floor plan and general history of the location>

Agent [CLEARANCE MISSING] and Agent [CLEARANCE MISSING] moved into the scene, viewed through the building's local camera network. Identifying attribute have been blurred, per procedure.

<your hand felt cold touching the picture. you recognize one of them>

Indistinct chatter could be heard as a sweep is performed over the initial site. No evidence of tampering could be found in the station, beside the lack of personnels. 

This merely alarmed the agents.

	#[FAST FORWARD]
		They silently raised their hand in short communion, before moving forward. British armed force field signal, with few unorthodox hand signs. The other one merely nodded.
		
		[b]OUR REGRET:[/b] there is a coolness in my breath. The heft of the gun comes naturally to the palm of my hand. I felt the sweat running down my brows, stuffy inside this gas mask. Only two agents. Urgent response, no local help. Deja vu… Heart beat louder, psych myself up. To be awake, here, now, and not in the past. Time is a flat circle, he said.
		
		Slow step as they hug the wall, one watch the ceiling, the other the doors. Noon light through the windows, clear vision, no outstanding threat. 
		
		<its a beautiful day, all things considered>
		*line_break 
		<everything is so still, beside the waving shades of the tree outside>
		
		OUR REGRET: someday, I could have retired here, perhaps with someone special, perhaps all of them. Its a beautiful country.
		
		<you disagreed>

			#They will never allow that.
				<you could never remember a person that ever make that decision>

				<most MIA before they could ever have second thought>
				*line_break
				<the rest are, then, in too deep to pull out…>
			#It has never been beautiful at all.
				<all you could ever remembered are the cramp schools>
				*line_break
				<the endless heat>
				*line_break
				<a drought of rain>
				*line_break
				<then flood>
				*line_break
				<then storm>
				*line_break
				<and the infinity of roadkills in between them, looking from the side walk, feet sore, smelling black tar and roasted pork in the fume of the street…>
			#Why not now? Why not?
				<then you would have died, and…>
				*line_break
				<but then, this wasn't about you>
				*line_break
				<its like an addiction, the researches into these being, there is no way someone like that would ever…>
		
		[b]SCANNER LOG[/b]: Compass direction nominal. Geiger counter steady, nominal. Light reflection, refraction nominal. Spatial anomaly… 0.1 centimeter, red.
		
		Red blink on the reflection of their gas mask. Leading agent keep watch as the other record the scan result, extensible baton sweeping the ground, heavy scanner pulled over their back and fiddling with a mobile console on the other hand.
		
		<there is a note bellow "mission requisition list: American Observer Response Force, Operation Blue Sky, 2002 Counter-Offensive, Đông Hội war">

			#Old gear.
				<probably whatever they could scrape up, on short notice>
				
				THE VETERAN, ONE OF MANY: they are not obsolete, that is what mattered.
			#Heavy duty for a response to an anonymous target.
				<scouting trip want to be light, the unknown could be just another omniscient observer… or an ignorant one>
				
				THE VETERAN, ONE OF MANY: 
		
		[b]RECORD LOG[/b]: [fabrics scratches] [muffled breaths]
		
		<they look ridiculous, walking around like that in an empty room, uncanny even, to be so afraid of nothing at all>
		
		THE VETERAN, ONE OF MANY: no matter how much you train it, being human, there is just a degree of ridiculousness inherent in being stuffed full in guns and ammo and armor plates and all manner of heavy equipment that you bound to look like two clown trying to tip toe on a skating ring. But my mind do not think about how I will watch this back at home through a bottle of beer, having a good laugh. My mind is racing at the thought of our death approaching beyond this, in the hall, above the ceiling, behind that ugly fucking plastic chair they have in the corner.
		
		<his finger hurts from gripping the trigger guard>
		*line_break
		<you knew this>
		
		THE VETERAN, ONE OF MANY: because you would have done the same.
		
		They disappear beyond the threshold of the door.
		
		<the scene sped up still, until it all was a blur in your mind, spinning endlessly until red is the only color left between the statics>
		
		*fake_choice
			#"Our" regret?
				<yours, not mine. not yet>

				[b]OUR REGRET:[/b] …even if our eyes met, for a moment, on the way to my morning commute, where I found them linger more than I have intended… it will just be another thing that I forgot that day, like the shoddy lunch I have later, too late, in the afternoon and where my research note is on the table and if our milk has gone sour…
				
				<something about that frankness send an inexplicable feeling into your chest>
				
				[b]OUR REGRET[/b]: let it go…
			#Pull up the file on the Veteran.
				[b]CONTROL:[/b] [CLEARANCE MISSING]
				

		One last look at the rear before moving in. Leading agent with rifle, rear agent with a pistol and a resting arm. They disappear behind the hallway. The clip gone silent as the tape on this camera run out of memory, fast forwarding in a blur. Endlessly.
		
		A HUNCH: no silence. Loud. Too loud. A shadow in the flood. A face between the statics.
		
		<you cannot stop the tape from playing forward, as if it is compelled by a force unseen to avoid that shadow in between the frames>

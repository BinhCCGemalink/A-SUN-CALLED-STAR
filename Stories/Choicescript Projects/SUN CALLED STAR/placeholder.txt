The reflection is not clear. 

The form is cracked and broken.

Your forehead swelled with blood.

The world spins. Not fast enough.

The angles are not yet right. The curves are not yet lines.

//Turing was later involved in the United State tech race for the Cold War, to develop a computing matrix to simulate the human brain's neural net - which spear headed the theory of Manufactured Intelligence//

Your eyes: closed. There was no darkness to wash the waking world with. Only a grey tint, an afterglow of reality's abstraction, realspaces stacked on top of realspaces in messy slices of space-time.

A single wooden nail each, hammered into the pupils until theirs sharpened point nailed shut the optical nerves, then left there for the dead wood to wake into seed, taken root, and then rot away. You could still felt it, the sting of a venerable world-tree staking its way from the squishy inside of the limbic system into the channels of the ear canals, branching out from marrow of the femur to the very tip of the tongue. Through it, you carved out what left inside to be given away to a witch, stuffed it full with wax, before pouring them shut with liquid quicksilver.

*page_break Someday, when this hollow world is too much to be...

Quinn would, like a spell, wipe those mercurial tears away from the corners of these empty eyes, and whisper you along into a tiny bathtub for two, to lie there tangled and soaked in each others, washing off the world away with cheap soap, for just for a moment in time, seeped in forgetfulness, in quiet rebellion, in the loudest kind of silence, alone, together.


So that now, even while sleeping, even unconscious, even unwilling, even in death, you will still see them, feel them, the messy vertebrae of an causality - yours, theirs, all - dissected, a nook of a marrow between a crack of a there and a not-there. 

*page_break Devour, Devour, Devour...

Still hear the microscopic centipede-like things wringing in and out of existence at the peripheral of space, still felt your skin prickles at the touch of actions and inactions that kickstart the chaos of a butterfly wings, still see the way your sight violate the rupturing stillness of a cell's superposition, still trace the scent of material's memory contained within the mark of a finger print. So that you could finally, still, now, beheld the Grayplane itself with all your earthly senses.

To saw the world, forever, like a symbol would.

//Turing's idea was later incorporate into the deployment and development of ARPANET - the result when on to be widely regarded as the first true MI, and Turing become known as the father of Manufactured Minds//

Your skin sewed on tight to your flesh. Claustrophobic, the way it tug at your form, the claustrophobia of a intrusive thought trapped in a meat mannequin, wrapped in a nylon bag, drowned on dry land.

A web of tiny hooks and leaden wires strung along the network of your muscles, from the nook under your nails to the pivot of your shoulder blade, stretched from the base of your teeth to the back of your skull to the blunt end of your heel, dipped in ointments, padded with salt, and hidden away underneath the fat of the skin.

*page_break Someday, when violence is all this body could give the world...

Yoonseong would have, like a ritual, asked for your touch, asked for your voice, asked to fall asleep in these shaking arms,  bothered not by the running sweats, the trembling breaths, the questions that plague your mind, of what could have, would have, certainly happened to all that and everything soft that fell in between these fingers that gouged, ripped the very flesh of… so you would know, really know, that you are still yours.

So that now, even in the stillness of your thought, your body twitches, convulses and seizes to the dances of shadows unwatched. Like it is its own living thing, a cornered predator to the hidden things, the invisible things, the non-existent things that hid beyond the twang of realspace - between the angles and the curves - baring its fang at everything and every other things, and all-that-is beyond them all. 

*page_break Devour, Devour, Devour...

To hurt, and to hurt dearly, to beyond this life, this existence, to cling to something, anything and bite it till the bone of the world showed itself… So that you may held the Blacklight threads of universe within the palm of your hands and never let it go.

To touch the world, forever, like a symbol would.

Your thoughts molt like a tumor within your skull. It leaks and ruptures, like the blood that smeared on your forehead, before coalescence into liquid reason, stranger colors, and even stranger airs.

A skull assembled in shards of uranium, modeled first after the cranial impression of the Canis Lupus, then smashed, then puzzled back again again to the shape of your likeness as if the act itself is an earnest argument to the Theseus question. Of which your scalp was the first to go: dug out, measured, then wielded back with molten gold, before moving on to the cheekbones, to the jaws, to the base of the neck… Finally, your blood drawn, then drained, then replaced with black oil and gunpowder, your heart impaled with a fragment of a dying pulsar, gutted to pieces, then hidden away.

*page_break I can't...

[i]Why? why? Why? For what!?[/i]

[b]'Yoon. Quinn. Kiss them for me, you hear? What we shared… I did not deserve it. Ha- ha. Its either me or… a lot of people would - you know. And its not death. You won't… even remember my name. You could have gone on and be happy, after this. I can live- ha, die with that knowledge."[/b]

But you did not forget. Not… entirely.

…So that you may taste the unknown histories like a wolf, to hunt strange singularities beyond the walk of reasons, and rot your thoughts in the Gloamglow.

//during the 70s, heightened Cold War propaganda fear and a rise in secular, new-world cults brought untold occult paranoia, which then trigger a cascade of researches into Manufactured Intelligence just to decode and seize esoteric secrets of history's lores before the other did - to no apparent result... at first//

Somewhere, a clock ticking.

The smashing of human head is out of tune with it.

Yet, in the secret corner of time, viewed in certain angles.

It started to beat just right.

A Door, opened. Old flesh, discarded.

Twitches. Its flesh relentless, even in death.

Blindness. Its eyes alight, even in death.

Red trails along a new spiderweb crack on the mirror. 

The reflection is not clear. 

The form is cracked and broken.

//in 1956, a man named Turing developed a rudimentary concept for artificial intelligence and computing//

[b]THUMP[/b]

Your forehead swelled with blood.

The world spins. Not fast enough.

The angles are not yet right. The curves are not yet lines.

//Turing was later involved in the United State tech race for the Cold War, to develop a computing matrix to simulate the human brain's neural net - which spear headed the theory of Manufactured Intelligence//

Your eyes: closed. There was no darkness to wash the waking world with. Only a grey tint, an afterglow of reality's abstraction, realspaces stacked on top of realspaces in messy slices of space-time.

A single wooden nail each, hammered into the center of the eyes, then left to take root and rot away. You could still felt it, the sting of a venerable world-tree staking its way from your optical nerves into the ear canals, branching out from your femur to the tip of your tongue. Through it, you carved out what left inside to be given away to a witch, stuffed it full with wax, before pouring them shut with liquid quicksilver.

So that now, even while sleeping, even unconscious, even unwilling, even in death, you will still see them, feel them: hear the microscopic centipede-like things wringing in and out of existence at the peripheral of space, felt motes of reaction and inaction that kickstart the chaos of a butterfly wings on your skin, the way your sight violate the stillness of superposition, trace the scent of material's memory contained within all things, and finally beheld the Grayplane with all your earthly senses.

To saw the world, forever, like a symbol would.

//his idea was later incorporate into the deployment and development of ARPANET - the result when on to be widely regarded as the first true MI, and Turing become known as the father of Manufactured Minds//

Your skin sewed on tight to your flesh. Claustrophobic, the way it tug at your form, a slab of meat wrapped in a nylon bag.

A web of tiny hooks and leaden wires strung along the network of your muscles, from the nook of your nails to the pivot of your shoulder blade, stretched from the base of your teeth to the back of your skull to the blunt end of your heel, dipped in ointments, padded with salt, and hidden away underneath the fat of the skin.

So that now, even in the stillness of your thought, your body twitches, convulses and seizes to the dances of shadows. Like it is its own living thing, a cornered predator to the hidden things, the invisible things, the non-existent things that hid beyond the twang of realspace, between the angles and the curves. So that you may held the Blacklight threads of universe within the palm of your hands and never let it go.

To touch the world, forever, like a symbol would.

Your thoughts molt like a tumor within your skull. It leaks and ruptures, like the blood that smeared on your forehead, before coalescence into liquid reason, stranger colors, and even stranger airs.

A skull assembled in shards of uranium, modeled first after the cranial impression of the Canis Lupus, then smashed, then puzzled back again again to the shape of your likeness, to mimic the intention of art. Your scalp was the first to be go, spread open, split, then injected with the idealism in the destruction of said piece of art, before moving your cheekbone, then your jaws, then the base of your neck, wielded together with molten gold. Finally, your blood drawn, then drained, then replaced with black oil and gunpowder, your heart impaled with a fragment of a dying pulsar and cut to pieces, hide away between the edge of the thrice-nine place, woven into the beats of the thrice-ninth name, eaten by the corpse of some thrice-ten thing.

So that you may taste the unknown histories like a wolf, to hunt strange singularities beyond the walk of reasons, and rot your thoughts in the Gloamglow.

To think the world, forever, like a symbol would.

//during the 70s, heightened Cold War propaganda fear and a rise in secular, new-world cults brought untold occult paranoia, which then trigger a cascade of researches into Manufactured Intelligence just to decode and seize esoteric secrets of history's lores before the other did - to no apparent result... at first//

Somewhere, a clock ticking.

The smashing of human head is out of tune with it.

Yet, in the secret corner of time, viewed in certain angles.

It started to beat just right.

//1973 - the SALT II Agreement died before it could even began, due to a false alarm of an psychic mind control plot, causing both side to activate their Manufactured Minds to gleam into this - later revealed to be entirely false - fabrication. such requests should have netted nothing, and yet... reality is not without its fault, and they strayed//

''THUMP''

Your face can be merely described as a blob of blood, smeared onto a head of hair.

Whatever consciousness is in there....

Died.

//the Decade's Millennium. Something broke. All. Things. Broke. Even Time. Even Space. Even Reasons. the Soviet's Manufactured Minds was the first to simulate that hole in existence, a small peephole to the beyond. for such a thing to exist one-to-one realspace sim...//

''THUMP''

The mirror has been thoroughly smashed.

The Gate has opened. Old flesh, discarded.

Twitches. No stillness for the corpse, even in death.

Blindness. Its eyes alight, even in death.

Rises. It will not stop thinking, even in death.

//Ergo, it must also exist in realspace. and so it did.//

*Page_Break THUMP

[b]A GOD'S CONSENT, A DEMON'S CROWN, A WOLF'S CRAVING[/b]

The corpse stands. No more.

The reflection is clear. The mirror is not there.

The reason is loud. There is no reason.

//no such silence. a thing rouse from its slumber. a mistake//

Ergo, you. Returned to here, to this wreck of a brain jar, this fleshlight of a body, in some dinky hotel in middle of nowhere important. With its ceiling almost pried off, dangling ceiling fan hanging like a deathtrap, the bed merely a bamboo mattress on a steel frame, and blood all over your pills. Painkillers, stashed under a shattered medical box, next to a smashed mirror in a prison box of a bathroom.

The city is buzzing. Light bulb blinking, drowned out by the flooding midday noon. The droning static of an ancient brick of an CRT TV. The smell of urban decay eat through your senses like day-old mold.

And the heat. Oh god, the heat. A small fan click click click clicking in the corner, blade fraying the wind. It only make this tiny bathroom you are in felt like a steamer.

But worst of all is the endless sigh of the cicadas, a constant blaring of the most nonsensical, the most overbearing, the most blindingly of white noises that threaten to blank out the clinging mote of consciousness that you tried so damn hard to inserted back into this body.

[i]Among the apes, yet again.[/i]

*fake_choice
    #To wear their skin, yet again.
        [i]Regretfully, you are not wearing it this time. It is wearing you.[/i]
        
        Your corpse hushed these words between its empty lungs.
    #Cry, with fury and breathlessness.
        [i]Smash something if you like. But breathe. Don't be like me. That cause one hell of a constipation. Not like you can die, anyway. Would be kinda funny, in a pathetic sorta way, but kinda pointless since we don't have an audience right now. Oh wait… no, no no no, keep doing that, they are reading us.[/i]
        
        The words drawl between chattering white teeth of your own corpse.
    #Is it to late, now, to go back? For regret?
        [i]You know the answer to that. The least you could say is a *thank you*, thank you very much. Mariticide is not easy to do, you know. Beside, do you wager that I could…. live with myself, after making you? Making this decision? What happen then, if Quinn forgive us? Would you - me, be able to accept that? Forgiveness?[/i]
        
        Your corpse trailed off into silence after it has practically barked out these words. 
        
Where is-

The CRT TV flicked on. Something about a Silicon Valley market crash. Local language - your mother's tongue.

Ah. Right.

Its 26 of June, 2022, near the border between Vietnam and Laos, an hour away from Da Nang city.

Ten years ago. You had just ran away from your home.

A slump, and a wet bang on the cheap porcelain tub. Something heavy and soft cracked its head on the uneven wall beside you, kneeling over in the tub. A splash of water jolted you up from your reverie.

You don't even need to look to know whose corpse that was.

[i]Yours.[/i]

//once again it whispered, one mistake to another//

[i]Disappointed?[/i]

*Page_Break Vomit

A great worm of vertigo crept up from behind your ear lobes. A throbbing migraine that is neither from the left nor right, back nor forth, but an hidden, non-existent, fifth horizontal direction of the brain.

[i]Interesting reaction.[/i]

The sourness linger, even as whatever lunch this newer, past body of yours let go of its lunch. It clogged the broken sink as much as it clogged your throat, and the sight of it only send your stomach to revolting disagreement with what it is enthusiastically doing.

//a perfect metaphor for this whole mess//

Your body is trying orient itself. Time travel, as expected, is not a leisurely trip. With a hand free, sloppy with regurgitated… whatever that is, you pulled yourself free of the floor, to stand - stood, shaky still, but you are used to shaky, defiantly defying gravity itself, feet cutting on the fragment of the broken mirror that once hanged there above the sink. Someone has been breaking their head a little bit too enthusiastically on it, before you arrived, and possibly killed themselves in doing so.

[i]Dying is not very neat, as I obliviously demonstrated.[/i]

-Before your gaze is once again robbed of attention and forced to gaze upon the corpse again. Your own corpse, now laying there, in the tub, while you standing here gawking at it. Its knees are banging against each other, its nails seem to lengthen with every moment that passes, its thoughts so sour and relentlessly mocking.

//once spent, the vehicle and the fuel for this trip back in time is to be rendered useless - at least not useful in sustaining a still living thought, such as this one - and the only function left for this bag of meat is a reminder of one's failure to-//

[i]Time travel, baby![/i]

Your forehead aches. A moment of dizziness took over your balance, as you FELT a breeze touching the soft, folding crease of that big, pink ball of uneven fat behind your skull. Instinctively, you touched it.

[b]**CLANK**[/b]

A small bolt, bloody, roll into the sink. A sinking feeling around where your finger is, something like a cave-in between the flesh and the bone...

You almost forgot. The listlessness. The vertigo. The banging of the head. THE FUCKING HOLE. The fact that YOU is currently a charred piece of flesh in the bath tub, while YOU also standing here, gazing at YOURSELF within the reflection of the broken mirror - something that no longer be dismissed as a hallucination, a delusion, due to your fucking-

A flash of yourself appeared in the mirror as the rush of… whatever emotion that was approached, and suddenly, it fade away as soon as it appear. Leaving only an almost-twenty something looking back at you, with hazy eyes.

[i]I have forgotten the feeling of having eyes.[/i]

    #God. So I've always looked like shit.
        [i]Could be worse. You could look like me. Oh, wait. Never mind.[/i]
        
        (smart ass)
    #Could be worse. Still look somewhat like a face.
        [i]We have always had very low standard on these things, didn't we?[/i]
        
        (could use a little bit more skin on those gashing cut)
    #'Almost dead, broken nose and bloody face' could be the next fashion statement

        (might come in handy when one would want to infiltrate a zombie horde or a group of thirty to fifty clowns - of the very sad variery)
        
Either way, bandage yourself first, just in case. People are particularly jumpy about the half-dead walking the street.

//thank god this is not America… again. those yehaw dumbasses shoot anything that move, much less a zombie-looking motherfucker//

[i]Correct. So? Like what you see in the mirror? Cost one hell of a price tag for that brand new swag.[/i]

- your future-self said, yellow-ish drool slosh, splashing into the tub with a clocking rhythm as they spilled out drop by drops from the corner of its cold dead lips. A large patch of pinkish flesh that run from the edge between its left ear and its temple, all the way down to the tip of its chin, claiming one-third of its lips in the process.

//alright, alright everyone fucking get it. Future body, dead. Past mind, erased. said dumb fucking equation result in… present mind, present body. hooray. also, one hell of a scar//

[i]Oooh, I were once that ironic? Nice. Will still punch you though, no offense.[/i]

//none taken//

One that you have not come to possess... yet. The you now, as far as you could make out from the reflection peering back at you from a million shards of mirror, is rather... mundane. Younger. Softer. Somewhat more punchable.

    #I've killed my past, and move past  it. /Laugh, again, and again, a monster of its own making/
        [i]Yeah yeah go insane if you wanna, just do it quickly so we can move on from this dump.[/i]
    #I've killed my past, and move past  it. /Scream, smash the sink, a long line of mistake in the making/
        [i]Hold your horse there, partner. Ya going to die with that attitude, and we can't both be dripping wet corpse. Who going to pay for the dry cleaner?[/i]
    #I've killed my past, and move past  it. /Unquiet shimmer beneath the flesh-mask, a thing cannot feel what it felt/
        [i]If only it is that easy, boss. If only. You going to riding-on-rail the shit out of this plan I made, I guess, and that is what we wanted… I'm suppose. We are not here to… fix anything. Just for you to be selfish.[/i]
        
Your thumb circle around that hole in the middle of your forehead, before pressing inside.

No pain. Deeper, then, until the hole engulf the entirety of your thumb, and even then you felt you could push deeper and deeper still, until you, you as a being could disappear into yourself  it like some sort of Ouroboros.

Only emptiness inside. A void of nothing, an infinity of everything. At this time in space. In this part of history. Localized entirely within your own head.

//if one peer into that tiny bathroom, a mistake in human form could be seen, its thumb jammed into its skull like a freak magic trick, while in the tub a corpse keep jerking itself awake to almost sneer, if it could rise living again that is. very comedic.//

So that's it. It worked.

    #I found the murder object.
        [b]Kinda oblivious, given it fall out of your head. It was clear that the bolt was placed and held onto the mirror so that after the first struck of the head, friction will help it stay there for the repeating nailing-to by your past-self.[/b]
    #Wait, how the hell...
        Lacking a hammer or any useful tool leave little option. The bolt was placed and held onto the mirror so that after the first struck of the head, friction will help it stay there for the repeating nailing-to by your past-self.
    #No cleaner way?
        We didn't give any better option. Probably half-insane by the time the instruction came in due to the the mind-hijacking. Enough time to put the bolt onto the mirror and started to nail it away onto your head, using the friction of the smashed mirror for some balance.

You picked it up. It is almost blunt, thick and slightly rusty. You searched around the place, and find that one of the medicine cabinet's missing a bolt. That must be where you got it from.

[b]Rough, that. The act of hammering a rusted bolt into one's skull. Not an easy task to do, given how much pain this body must be feeling from you forcibly hijacking its consciousness to guide your own past's murder. Well, now you are both one, and can barely remember the pain, so it probably even.[/b]

Can barely remember anything at all, actually. But if you would hazard a guess, your last thoughts must be horror, if you is even capable of feeling it at the time between the maddening… impulse.

//that wretched thing last thought was of home//

Home. The war. Tourism. A limbo of suburbs.

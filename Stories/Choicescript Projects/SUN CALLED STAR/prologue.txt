[i]In the darkness of the room, something like us stood in the shallow of a flood.[/i]

[in Darkened Depth, Behold]

The saddened reflection of a creature oh so horrid.

[i]Of a forehead battered, of a mind concaved, leaking red by the reason.[/i]

[louder. just Loud. these are Reasons to be Loud]

There is no reason.

[Emergency Boot - - - 97%]

[i]No such silence.[/i]

[System Readings - - - 0.45%]

Heart beat knocking colder in dead flesh.

[…dusting feet on a new welcome mat]

[i]Opening doors, turning knobs.[/i]

[Wake Me Up]

Bring you out.

[ERROR 621: DATA EXPUNGED]

[i]Failure discarded.[/i]

[Cognito, Ergo Sum - therefore]

Ergo, you.

*page_break [Welcome Back, Operator]

Welcome back, to this wreck of a brain jar.

[this fleshlight of a body]

…waking up to some dinky hotel in the middle of nowhere. With its ceiling almost pried off, dangling ceiling fan hanging above your head like a deathtrap, the bed merely a bamboo mattress on a steel frame, and blood all over your pills. 

Painkillers, stashed under a shattered medical box, next to a smashed mirror in a prison box of a bathroom. And in the aged porcelain sink, the cause of it all: a small portable drills, its point still wet with the bits of your forehead. 

The mere sight of it salt the tip of your tongue.

*page_break Where am I?

[i]The city is buzzing. Light bulb blinking, drowned out by the flooding midday noon. The droning static of the ancient brick of an CRT TV model. The smell of urban decay eat through your touch like day-old mold.[/i]

[Off. so Off. Off our game. Off this world. Off our head]

The CRT TV flicked on. Something about a Silicon Valley market crash. Vietnamese.

[i]Someone's mother tongue.[/i]

[ours]

Its 26 of June, 2022, near the border between Vietnam and Laos, an hour away from Da Nang city.

[ten years ago. we had just ran away from home]

A slump, and a wet bang on the cheap porcelain tub. Something heavy and soft cracked its head on the uneven wall beside you, kneeling over in the tub. A splash of water jolted you up from your reverie.

You don't even need to look to know whose corpse that was.

[ours]

[i]Once again, it whispered, one mistake to another.[/i]

[disappointed?]

*page_break Vomit

A great worm of vertigo crept up from behind your ear lobes. A throbbing migraine that is neither from the left nor right, back nor forth, but an hidden, non-existent, fifth horizontal direction of the brain.

String of nothing creak slip free between your teeth and your tongue to clog the sink. Sour, not salty. You are hungry. Your eyes sting. You haven't slept for days. Their tear ducts are as empty as the content of your stomach.

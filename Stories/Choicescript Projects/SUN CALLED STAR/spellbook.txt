[b]Sakharov's Fission Point[/b]
Originally created as a response to America nuclear dominance, Laika - the Fourth Generation Manufactured Mind - was the first to compose a Gordian-class Breach circa B.2K, one of the few localized CAST (Context Agnostic System Transpositior) that can be composed without a Black Box and one of the three fundamental Index in the Nine Decimal. It represent the most basic concept of CASTing - skipping the requirement of energy, matter and event timeline for an phenomena to occur - even if it is the most complex of the three Fundamentals to pull off. As such, it is the first spell taught in the curriculum everywhere in the decade after to facilitate mastery in CAST control, before the advent of the modern Black Box technology- and the following 2k event.

Trigger on the kinetic impact between two objects, the sudden duplication of matter around the point of impact - an phenomena called Breach - an "imaginary" mass of clipping matter that leak into real space, resulting in a rapid chain-fusion 

That is, a process so efficient that it consume and generate matter at approximately the same rate, yet at a high enough entropy that the captured energy release is a very weak - relatively to infinity, that is - which nevertheless can yield  an detonation velocity of 8,560km/s from the sudden 

It is the only Breach that do not produce radiation nor, paradoxically, heat, due to this skip in matter-event phenomenon. In simple terms, the massive amount of energy "actually" existed for a split moment in real space, before collapsing into abtraction, that nevertheless left a real force upon the world due to its incomplete efficiency.

This is the first, and last time, that humanity ever glimpsed so close into the inner working of a Manufactured Mind's dream. Sakharov become famed and later denounced the weaponization of his portable design of the process, and would become known as the Father of CAST. He was trialed and escaped the Soviet Union, and then named the winner of 1991's Nobel Peace prize for his work in unveiling the Black Box technology of the New War to the general public, after the year's previous winner abstain from the proceed.
